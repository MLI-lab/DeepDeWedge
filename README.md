This repository contains an implementation of the DeepDeWedge method as described in our manuscript *["A Deep Learning Method for Simultaneous Denoising and Missing Wedge Reconstruction in Cryogenic Electron Tomography"]()*. 

## Installation
All you have to do is to install the minimal software requirements via
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Tutorial
To get started with DeepDeWedge, we strongly encourage you to have a look at our tutorial in `tutorial.ipynb`. See you there!
