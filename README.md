# DeepDeWedge

This repository contains an implementation of the DeepDeWedge method as described in our manuscript ["A Deep Learning Method for Simultaneous Denoising and Missing Wedge Reconstruction in Cryogenic Electron Tomography"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05539). 

## Installation
All you have to do is to install the minimal software requirements via
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Tutorial
To get started with DeepDeWedge, we strongly encourage you to have a look at our tutorial in `tutorial.ipynb`. There, we reconstruct the flagella of Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii based on data from the Tomo110 dataset, which was used in the tutorial for the related [CryoCARE](https://github.com/juglab/cryoCARE_T2T) denoising method.


## Contact

If you have any questions, or if you think you found a bug in the code, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:simonw.wiedemann@tum.de).
